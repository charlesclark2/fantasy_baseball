# E13.4 — Feature/Signal COVERAGE Completeness Dossier

**Status:** Inventory + gap-map COMPLETE; candidate testing PRE-REGISTERED, lift-runs handed to operator (long fits).
**Date:** 2026-06-22
**Author track:** Model-A (edge direction)
**Purpose (operator's exit criterion):** make the H2H/totals "no edge" conclusion *defensible as a coverage conclusion* — i.e. we checked the signal **axes**, not just the columns we happened to have. Until coverage is demonstrably complete, "no edge" only means "no edge given what we happened to model." This dossier closes that gap.

---

## 0. TL;DR — the headline finding (read this first)

**The story's motivating premise was half-right, and the correction is itself the most valuable deliverable.**

- **TRUE:** the FanGraphs in-season rolling leaderboard (7d/14d/30d wRC+/wOBA/discipline/exit-velo/bat-tracking) is ingested + preserved in `stg_fangraphs__hitting_leaderboard` and reaches **ZERO** modeling feature. The entire in-season hitting-leaderboard branch dead-ends (only ZiPS *projections* and season-grain Stuff+/arsenal reach features). Confirmed column-by-column (§2.3).
- **FALSE (the important correction):** the claim that "there is **NO** form/momentum/recency axis in any contract." There is, and it is **heavy** — just sourced from **Statcast**, not FanGraphs. Every champion contract carries 7/14/30d rolling windows for team scoring, team run-prevention, starters, and bullpen, plus feature-layer trend/drift deltas. The E2.1 per-side totals model (the prioritized integration target) is the **richest** contract in the repo (308 features) and already carries the most explicit `_trend`/`_drift`/`_minus` momentum deltas (§3, §4).

**Consequence for the edge conclusion:** the temporal/recency *axis* is covered. The FanGraphs window gap the story leads with is **largely redundant** with the existing Statcast team-rolling offense (`off_woba_30d`, `off_xwoba_30d`, `off_hard_hit_pct_30d`, `off_barrel_pct_30d`, `runs_per_game_7d/14d/30d` all already exist and are leak-guarded). So filling it is unlikely to move a number. The genuine, non-redundant, leak-clean, free gaps are **narrow and specific** — chiefly **times-through-order (TTO)** and two **hypothesis-driven interaction terms**. This narrows where the remaining edge search should point and makes a subsequent null **trustworthy**.

## 1. Method & sources audited

Inventory assembled from direct reads of: live model registry + contract JSONs; `feature_pregame_*` models; `mart_*rolling*` marts; FanGraphs staging + marts; `baseball_data_mart_inventory.md`; `sport_data_platform.md`; `gtm_strategy.md §0` (spend discipline); and the E1.1 (purged CV) / E1.4 (PBO/DSR) / E1.8 (Stuff+ leak) methodology. Leak-safety verified at the as-of-join level. Standing memory confirmations cross-checked (FanGraphs leaderboard dead-end; team-OAA no-signal; weather CLOSED as noise).

**Leak doctrine carried forward (from E1.8):** season Stuff+ leaked because it was joined on `season = year(game_date)` with no date guard against a full-season-grain source → future peek (inflated importance ~88%; the peak signal WAS the leak). **Rule for every new feature in this audit:** season-grain external features join on **prior season** or strict as-of; rolling features must flow through the existing as-of resolver (`mart.game_date < spine.game_date`), never a raw `game_pk` join. Pattern-A marts (`... and current row`) are NOT pre-game-safe on their own.

## 2. INVENTORY (the four-layer column census)

### 2.1 Live contracts (what actually reaches a model)

| Target | Contract file | # feats | Recency content |
|---|---|---|---|
| home_win (champion v5) | `betting_ml/models/home_win/feature_columns_xgb_classifier_tuned_2026.json` | 211 | 72 window-flavored (30d×39, 14d×17, 7d×15) |
| run_diff (champion v5) | `betting_ml/models/run_differential/feature_columns_ngboost_tuned_2026.json` | 169 | 63 window-flavored |
| total_runs (champion v5) | `betting_ml/models/total_runs/feature_columns_ngboost_tuned_seasonnorm_2026.json` | 113 | 38 window-flavored |
| home_win pre-lineup (33.0) | `..._pre_lineup_home_win_fitted.json` | 156 | retains windows |
| run_diff pre-lineup | `..._pre_lineup_run_diff_fitted.json` | 126 | retains windows |
| total_runs pre-lineup | `..._pre_lineup_total_runs_fitted.json` | 89 | retains windows |
| **E2.1 per-side runs** (totals target) | `betting_ml/models/sub_models/totals_perside_v1/` (`train_perside_negbin.py`) | **275 num + 7 cat → 308** | **richest**; explicit `_trend`/`_delta`/`_drift`/`_minus` |
| v6 de-leaked challengers (E1.9, NOT promoted) | `..._pruned_clustered_deleaked_2026.json` | 13–19 | retains a few windows |

Registry source of truth: `betting_ml/models/model_registry.yaml` (`feature_cols` key). Market-blind enforced (CONTRACT-GUARD; `best_alpha = 0`).

**Axis coverage of the champions (all draw from `feature_pregame_game_features`):** starter/pitching aggregate (largest), offense aggregate, archetype/matchup (heavy), EB posteriors, bullpen, ELO/pythag, park, umpire, lineup. **Absent from champions:** weather (CLOSED as noise), market/odds (deliberate market-blind). **E2.1 per-side additionally covers:** weather, deep bullpen fatigue (`opp_bullpen_pitches_prev_1d/3d/7d`, `opp_closer_used_prev_1d/2d`), park dimensions, catcher framing.

### 2.2 Marts that compute recency (provenance + leak pattern)

| Mart | Entity | Windows | Leak pattern | Key metrics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mart_team_rolling_offense` | team batting | 7/14/30d + std | A (current row; guarded downstream) | **runs_per_game**, woba, xwoba, k%, bb%, hard_hit, barrel |
| `mart_team_rolling_pitching` | team run-prevention (starter/bullpen split) | 7/14/30d + std | A | **runs_allowed_per_game**, woba_against, xwoba_against |
| `mart_pitcher_rolling_stats` | individual pitcher | 7/14/30d + std | A | woba/xwoba_against, k%, bb%, whiff, velo, extension |
| `mart_starting_pitcher_game_log` | starter × game | cumulative | B (strictly prior) | xwoba_against, velo, IP, runs |
| `mart_starter_csw_rolling` | starter | 3-start + season | A | csw_pct |
| `mart_starter_pitch_mix_rolling` | starter | 5-start + season | A | pitch-mix % (→ drift) |
| `mart_bullpen_effectiveness` | bullpen | 14/30d | **B (1-day-preceding baked in)** | k%, bb%, xwoba_against, EB posteriors |
| `mart_bullpen_workload/leverage/handedness` | bullpen | prev 1/2/3/7d | B | pitches/appearances, closer/HL used, leverage |
| `mart_team_base_state_splits` | team RISP/runners-on | 30d | B | woba_with_risp_30d, runs_per_baserunner_30d |
| `mart_team_pythagorean_rolling` | team | 30d | B | pythagorean_residual_30d |

**Key answer for E2.2's autocorrelation lead:** team run-**scoring** form (`runs_per_game_7d/14d/30d`) AND run-**prevention** form (`runs_allowed_per_game_7d/14d/30d`) **already exist and are leak-guarded.** The autocorrelated team-scoring signal E2.2 flagged is already feature-available on both sides. Feature-layer deltas already built: `off_woba_7d_minus_30d`, `pit_xwoba_7d_minus_30d`, `fastball_velo_trend (7d−30d)`, `velo_delta_3start`, `k_pct_7d_minus_std`, `*_drift_5start`, `starter_trailing_fip_30g`.

### 2.3 Ingested-but-UNUSED (the dead-end census)

- **`stg_fangraphs__hitting_leaderboard` — ENTIRELY unused by features** (all ~70 cols × {7d,14d,30d,season}). Includes rolling wRC+/wOBA/OBP/ISO, expected stats (xwOBA/xAVG/xSLG), bat-tracking (bat speed, attack angle, swing length, blast/squared-up%), exit-velo (EV avg/90th/max, barrel%, hard-hit%), full plate-discipline & batted-ball, baserunning (UBR, wBsR, spd). Only an **offline EB-prior script** (`fit_lineup_priors.py`) reads it, season-window only.
- **`fct_fangraphs_hitting_analytics`** — pivots `rolling_wrc_plus_7d/14d/30d`, `rolling_obp_*`, `rolling_pa_*` but is consumed by **no feature** (dead-ends at a profile mart). 12 cols unused.
- **`fct_fangraphs_pitching_analytics`** — only `proj_fip`/`proj_xfip` used; `stuff_plus`/`location_plus`/`pitching_plus`/`proj_era`/`proj_k_pct`/... unused.
- **`pitcher_times_thru_order`** (`stg_batter_pitches.sql:413` = `n_thruorder_pitcher`; surfaced in `mart_pitch_pitcher_profile.sql:69`) — **raw column exists, engineered into ZERO pre-game starter feature.** ⬅️ the cleanest true gap.
- **`mart_team_schedule_context`** computes `travel_distance_miles`, `tz_delta_hours`, `is_getaway_day` — but only `days_rest`/`games_last_7d` are wired into `feature_pregame_team_features` (the rest exist in-mart, unwired).
- Offensive baserunning (UBR staged; sprint_speed ingested) used **only defensively**, not as a lineup offensive feature.

### 2.4 External / un-ingested (domain checklist)

Ingested MLB sources: Statcast/Savant (`batter_pitches` ~140 cols incl. `n_thruorder_pitcher`), MLB StatsAPI (schedule/lineups/venues w/ dims+elevation+`park_facing_degrees`/weather/umpire/transactions/clusters), FanGraphs (Stuff+, ZiPS/Steamer, rolling leaderboard, catcher framing, team OAA/DRS), Action Network (public %), Parlay API (live odds), Odds API (historical).

| # | Signal | Verdict | Note / cost |

| 2 | Catcher framing / battery | **PARTIAL** | season catcher aggregate only; no pitcher×catcher battery framing. FREE (derive from `batter_pitches`). |
| 3 | Park dims / handed factors | **HAVE dims / PARTIAL** | dims+elevation+factors present; missing wall heights, foul area, handedness-split factors. FREE/static. |
| 4 | Weather vector | **HAVE** | `wind_component_mph` = wind projected on park orientation. *Weather CLOSED as noise for totals.* |
| 5 | **Times-through-order** | **MISSING as feature** | raw `pitcher_times_thru_order` exists; no TTO penalty feature. **FREE (no new source).** ⬅️ top candidate |
| 6 | Baserunning value | **PARTIAL** | UBR/sprint staged but only defensive; offensive BsR not surfaced. FREE (wire). |
| 7 | Platoon splits | **HAVE** | batter vs LHP/RHP + pitcher vs LHB/RHB (prior-season grain). |
| 8 | Rest / travel | **PARTIAL** | days_rest/games_last_7d wired; travel/tz/getaway computed-but-unwired. FREE (dbt plumbing). |

## 3. GAP-MAP (three categories)

### (A) TEMPORAL / recency — **axis COVERED; one narrow non-redundant slice**
- Team scoring form, run-prevention form, starter form, bullpen form, velo/csw/mix drift, form-vs-baseline deltas: **all present, leak-guarded** (§2.2). E2.1 per-side is the richest.
- **Net-new slice:** FanGraphs in-season hitting **windows** (§2.3) — but **largely redundant** with Statcast `off_woba_30d`/`off_xwoba_30d`/`off_hard_hit_pct_30d`/`off_barrel_pct_30d`. The only orthogonal sub-slice: **park/league-adjusted wRC+** (Statcast woba is unadjusted) and **individual bat-tracking form**. → test orthogonality before any build; expectation = redundant.

### (B) COMBINATORY / derived — **3 hypothesis-driven gaps (no blanket generation)**
Already built (do NOT duplicate): platoon-adjusted lineup-vs-starter (`home_lineup_vs_away_starter_xwoba_adj`), bullpen handedness matchup, pitcher-cluster & batter-archetype matchups, lineup-vs-archetype, shrunk pitcher-batter H2H, bat-speed-vs-velo, injury-adjusted lineup, home−away differentials & pct-diff encodings, season-normalized z-scores.
- **B1. TTO penalty** (also category-A-adjacent): starter expected times-through-lineup × 3rd-time xwOBA penalty. Inputs exist raw; never engineered. **Genuine.**
- **B2. Bullpen-fatigue × expected-game-length:** `bullpen_pitches_prev_3d` (or `pitchers_used_prev_3d`) × `starter_avg_ip_last_3` (inverse). Domain: a tired pen bites harder when the starter is expected to be pulled early. Both inputs exist; no product term. **Genuine.** (Trees may capture implicitly → value is mainly the GLM lane + high-order/sparse region.)
- **B3. Park-factor × team-batted-ball:** `park_hr_factor` (or run factor) × `off_barrel_pct_30d`/`off_hard_hit_pct_30d`. Domain: a barrel/FB-heavy offense gains more in a launch-friendly park. Both inputs exist; no product term. **Genuine but lower** (weather/park thread already marginal; trees capture some).

### (C) EXTERNAL / un-ingested — **few free, mostly low-value or already-tested-null**
- **C1. Per-player/positional OAA summed to posted defense** (FREE, Savant) — different from the tested team prior-season aggregate, but the **defense/weather thread is CLOSED as no-signal**; ingestion cost; LOW priority, gate on prior evidence.
- **C2. Wire existing travel/getaway** (FREE, dbt only) — hygiene; rest/travel weak in MLB; LOW.
- **C3. Battery-specific framing** (FREE, derive) — niche, small; LOW.
- Wall heights / foul area / handed park factors / air density — minor, mostly closed-as-noise neighbors. **No PAID source needed to close any gap** (spend discipline satisfied — F5/paid not implicated here).

## 4. RANKING (orthogonality × market-underweighting × leak-clean availability × build cost)

| Rank | Candidate | Orthogonality | Mkt-underwt? | Leak-clean free? | Build | Verdict to test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **B1 TTO penalty** (starter) | High (vs aggregate stuff/woba) | Plausible (3rd-TTO well-documented, books price starter aggregate) | Yes (raw col, as-of) | Low | **TEST** |
| **2** | **B2 bullpen-fatigue × exp-game-length** | Medium | Plausible (interaction, not level) | Yes | Low (1 col) | **TEST** |
| 3 | A FanGraphs in-season wRC+ form (park-adj slice only) | **Low** (redundant w/ Statcast off_woba_30d) | Weak | Yes (prior-season/as-of) | Med | **TEST orthogonality first; expect REDUNDANT** |
| 4 | B3 park × batted-ball | Low-Med | Weak | Yes | Low | TEST (low priority) |
| 5 | C1 per-player OAA → posted defense | Med | Weak | Free but needs ingest | Med | **DEFER** (defense thread CLOSED) |
| 6 | C2 travel wiring / C3 battery framing | Low | Weak | Yes | Low | **HYGIENE only** (not edge) |

**Integration-target priority (per E2.2 §4.5):** the per-side **run MEANS** (E2.1) barely separate games (between-game mean-var 0.894) and team scoring form is more autocorrelated than single-game W/L → a recency/derived signal is most likely to move a number **there**. **Order: E2.1 per-side totals-means FIRST, H2H second.**

---

## 5. PRE-REGISTRATION (hypotheses + test protocol — register BEFORE the lift run)

Each candidate's hypothesis, build, and pass/fail are fixed here so the verdict can't be retrofit. Verdicts are produced by the operator's lift runs (§6); this dossier records them as PENDING.

**Candidate B1 — TTO penalty.** *Hypothesis:* a starter's projected times-through-order × his 3rd-TTO xwOBA delta adds incremental skill to per-side opponent run mean (and home_win) beyond aggregate starter stuff/woba, because the market prices the starter's average, not his fade. *Build:* `mart_starter_tto_splits` from `batter_pitches` grouped by `pitcher_times_thru_order` (1/2/3+), prior-season + trailing-as-of grain; feature `opp_starter_tto3_xwoba_penalty = xwoba(3+) − xwoba(1)`, shrunk to league mean by BF (n<150 → regress hard). *Pass:* incremental ΔCRPS (per-side) / Δlogloss (home_win) > 0 under PurgedWalkForwardSplit AND PBO < 0.2 AND DSR > 0 AND corr with existing `*_starter_xwoba_against_std` < 0.6.

**Candidate B2 — bullpen-fatigue × expected-game-length.** *Hypothesis:* `opp_bullpen_pitches_prev_3d × (1/starter_avg_ip_last_3)` lifts the per-side run mean because fatigue matters more behind a short-leash starter. *Build:* single interaction column in `feature_pregame_game_features_raw` from existing as-of inputs. *Pass:* same gate; corr with each parent < 0.7 (must be the interaction, not a level proxy).

**Candidate A — FanGraphs in-season form.** *Hypothesis (skeptical):* park/league-adjusted in-season wRC+ 7/14/30d adds orthogonal lineup-form signal over Statcast `off_woba_30d`. *Build:* wire `fct_fangraphs_hitting_analytics` rolling cols via prior-game as-of join, lineup-summed; apply 7d→season shrinkage (a 7d spike is mostly variance). *Pass:* FIRST gate = corr(new, `off_woba_30d`) < 0.7 (else RULE OUT as redundant, record null, do not fit). If it passes orthogonality, then the standard lift+PBO/DSR gate.

**Candidate B3 — park × batted-ball.** As above; lowest priority, run only if B1/B2 land.

**Shrinkage discipline (applies to all recency candidates):** a short-window value is mostly variance — every candidate must isolate *persistent change* via regression-to-mean (empirical-Bayes shrink toward the season/league mean by sample size) before entering the model. Raw 7d deltas are disallowed.

## 6. ⏭️ OPERATOR HANDOFF

**CI gate (this session):** no code/dbt changed yet — dossier + pre-registration only. Nothing to compile. Candidate builds (§5) ship only AFTER a passing lift verdict; each will carry its own `dbtf build --select state:modified+` + `dbtf compile` + `uv run pytest` gate at integration time.

**Run-order for the operator (long fits → operator):**
1. Build candidate B1 mart + feature (TTO) — *spec in §5; ~build then test, do not promote on build.*
2. Incremental-lift test, **per-side first**, against the v6/E2.1 contract:
   `uv run python betting_ml/scripts/rebaseline_purged_cv.py --target perside_runs --add-features <B1 cols> --pbo --dsr` (then `--target home_win`).
3. Repeat for B2; for Candidate A, run the **orthogonality pre-check first** (corr vs `off_woba_30d`) and STOP if ≥0.7.
4. Gate every winner on PBO < 0.2 AND DSR > 0 (`betting_ml/utils/overfitting.py`), purged CV via `betting_ml/utils/cv.py::PurgedWalkForwardSplit`.
5. Write per-candidate CV JSON to `quant_sports_intel_models/baseball/edge_program/ablation_results/e13_4_<candidate>_cv.json` (match `e2_1_perside_negbin_cv.json` shape). Ship winners into BOTH the E2.1 per-side marginals AND the H2H contract; record nulls.

**`git add` (this session):**
- `quant_sports_intel_models/baseball/edge_program/E13_4_COVERAGE_DOSSIER.md`

**Excluded from git:** none (no artifacts produced this session).

**Honest expectation (recorded):** MLB momentum is weak, markets move on form, and the most-promoted gap (FanGraphs in-season windows) is **largely redundant** with existing Statcast rolling offense. TTO (B1) is the single candidate with a genuine orthogonality + market-underweighting case; B2/B3 are interaction terms trees may already capture (value concentrated in the GLM lane). **A clean null after these tests is the deliverable** — it lets us honestly conclude the model track's value is product-quality (calibrated projections/distributions/transparency) + fantasy, not a betting edge. This dossier is the coverage proof that makes that null defensible: we checked the axes, not just the columns.
